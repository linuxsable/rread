- Setup a queue system that syncs blog articles in a smart way with weights

-- Q
- Each time a blog gets added to a reader, that blog has a column which gets incremented
- When a blog is added to the Q, that column is used as the priority
- It may be that we need to reverse this so that less used blogs have a higher priority because they'll be read less
